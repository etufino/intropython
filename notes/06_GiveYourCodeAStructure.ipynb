    "At some point in your python programming experience, you will start having continuous *deja-vu*'s, as you will find yourself coding the same algorithm over and over in different scripts. When people get to that point, they typically resort to copy-pasting the algorithm from some previous code, and then perhaps modifying it to adapt it to the needs of the new code. This often happens even within a group of script that belong to the same project, but this is **bad practice** which you should start avoiding as soon as possible, because it inevitably leads to the following situation: one day, you realize that the algorithm contained a bug, or simply it could be made more efficient, and then you have to change the code in *all the places you've copied it all around your scripts*, with a very high probability that you will end up having different versions of it co-living in your code. A disaster!"

    "In this brief lesson, we will see how one can avoid this bad practice by structuring the code as a *python package* and ultimately by importing your packages whenever you need them. The next step will be that of using a *version control system* (VCS) such as `git` to keep track of the evolution of your package and to be sure that you always know which version of your code you are using."

    "Starting with `python 3`, the folder structure where your scripts live in has become the main way to tell python that these constitute a package altogether. The idea is essentially that a folder represents a class, and this is made explicit by adding an `__init__.py` script into that folder, which behaves very much like the `def __init__()` method of a class: it serves to initialize the module when you import it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, say that we want to create a python module that computes *credible intervals* from parameter samples (a very typical situation nowadays!). You want to be able to construct both 1D credible intervals and 2D credible contours by binning your samples (obtained e.g. by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo) and applying a `greedy binning` algorithm, that is, you want to sum the bin frequencies in descending order until you reach a given fraction of the total samples (which represents your credible level). You may define a function that does so with a 1D array of samples, something like this:"
